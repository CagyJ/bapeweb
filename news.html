					<h5>Story</h5>
					<p>BAPE started with T-shirts, each producing only 50 pieces, 30 of which were distributed to employees and friends, and only a small amount went to the market. Someone asked how he made money? BAPE is not established for the purpose of making money. To put it bluntly, it is to play with yourself. Because there are many other jobs at the end of the long tail, the income is not a problem, so he insists on product quality and needs to be satisfied with the people around him. In the first two years, Bape only designed T-shirts. Due to its unique design and quality assurance, the product limited edition can show the personality of the wearer and has a little reputation among Japanese hipsters. After that, BAPE began to set foot in the design of other costumes.</p>
					<p>In 1998, Japan’s popular Tenjin Kimura Takuya appeared in TV commercials wearing BAPE clothes. BAPE quickly set off a wave of enthusiasm in Japan. After that, many Japanese artists such as Asano’s faithfulness and one-colour yarns passed through BAPE and TV in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Many artists, such as Andy Lau, Edison Chen, Cecilia Cheung and so on. Every time the show is almost BAPE. In fact, many artists in Hong Kong and Taiwan in Japan love to wear very classic styles or limited editions that are difficult to get. The trend of this thing is largely follow-up. Everything that is popular now will be followed, but it will not be worn for a while. However, regardless of others, people who have their own ideas, others who are comfortable to look at are truly trendy people.</p>
					<p>NIGO is so successful, and according to himself, he has always been based on his own preferences, without considering the needs of consumers or the market reaction. But the effect every time is surprisingly good. For many of the same original brands, it means a little bit of standing and not hurting. After all, not operating a brand for the purpose of making money is not big for most people. possible.
							Another important reason for NIGO's success is that he is also an important promoter of trend culture. He has been committed to introducing international trend art into Japan, and he is also actively cooperating with various art design or commercial units to promote trend culture. It’s natural to say that the brand of the Harajuku system is not a classmate or a friend. The cooperation has never been interrupted. Others such as Pepsi, ADIDAS, Microsoft, etc., are topics every time. Cooperation is with the famous American street graffiti artist KAWS. A series of products produced in cooperation.</p>
